# Cloud-Enabled-Attendance-System
We can use a cloud-enabled automatic attendance system to scan details. Also, all the scanned information can be directly synchronized and stored on the cloud in real-time. Detailed information like check-in time, check-out time, date, and total working hours, to name a few, can be stored and saved.
